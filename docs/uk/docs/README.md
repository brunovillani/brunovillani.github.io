# About these notes

When I first started writing about coding, it was to keep notes of the cool stuff I find on the internet and improve my skills. Later, reading the notes again, I thought they could be shared with my colleagues at work, helping us to do more with less effort. I use them to help me organizing ideas, explaining concepts and PoC projects. They're usually a resume of ideas, so I add the source links from my researches to check later for details if necessary.
